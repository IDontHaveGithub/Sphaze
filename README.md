# Sphaze
2D space game, first game I ever made. initially made end 2017.

Sphaze was the first time I got a project to make for school, it was a group project for two people, originally we had to share responsibilities between ourselves so we would both be doing parts of the website and the game. But in our group it worked out better for me only to work on the game and for my partner to work on the website, as we were both planning to do just that for the next year.

The idea was to make a space game, a 2D platformer, about a genderless character named Orion who is a bountyhunter. Together with their robot dog Gizmo they would go throughout the entirety of space and follow their mission.
Their missions would be given by a space ninja, this ninja would also look around in the locations beforehand and give Orion a heads up about things they needed to look out for.

The name Sphaze comes form the fact that Orion would have equipment to phase through walls and it's in space.

Because it's the first project I ever made I made a couple of weird choices, such as reused code for all enemies which I could have put into one script. Also I used coroutines just because that was the only way I knew to create a delay and a lot of other things.
And the MadLibs part of the game doesn't work, as that was just a hurried attempt to make something we didn't have time for and the prefabe broke when trying to open the project after a year and a half.


I've recently added a reset button in the build to get out of the ground, as the colliders will sometimes break and the Player will get stuck in the ground.
